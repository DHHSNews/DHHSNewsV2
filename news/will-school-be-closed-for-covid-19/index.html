      Will School be Closed for COVID-19?
    </h1>

    <h3>
      <div style="width:80%">
        Recently in Connecticuit, there has been a large ammount of talk about
        the new virus "COVID-19", or more known by "Coronavirus". As of this
        writing on Friday, March 13, there are
        <a
          href="https://www.wnpr.org/post/connecticut-has-run-only-90-covid-19-tests-s-problem"
          >four confirmed cases in CT.</a
        >
        So far, there are over
        <a
          href="https://www.wfsb.com/news/more-than-schools-announce-closures-due-to-coronavirus/article_08315942-63a9-11ea-8a8d-fbf599c94a44.html"
          >100</a
        >
        out of
        <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Public_education_in_Connecticut"
          >1,148 Connecticuit schools</a
        >
        closed. These schools include, the New Haven Public School District,
        which is closed for an undefinded time and Stanford schools are closed
        for two weeks.

        <br />
        <br />
        This brings up the question: Will Madison Public Schools close? There is
        no way to say for certain, but it is likley due to the growing concerns
        of COVID-19 and the recent announcement from Govener Lamont that the CT
        will be waiving the 180 school attendance rule. As of this writing,
        school is not closed, but you can you our
        <a href="/close/">school closure tool</a> to see if school is cancelled.
