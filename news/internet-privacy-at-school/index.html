      Internet Privacy at School
    </h1>
    <br>
    <h3>
      <div style="width:80%">

      Have you ever been surfing the web at school and gotten this screen ?
          You have encountered the web filter, also known as
          <a href="https://securly.com">Securly</a>, the software Madison Public
          Schools uses to keep students safe from inappropriate content on the
          internet. However this may come at a cost to students. Upon reading
          the
          <a href="https://securly.com/privacy">Securly, Inc. privacy policy</a
          >, we can find out how exactly data from what is called the “services”
          (software and other Securly products) is being shared. According to
          how we share your information section, they will share information
          with third parties to “perform functions on our behalf including
          helping us provide you with the Services”. They will also contribute
          data to a legal case, if requested such as in a subpoena. They will
          also share non-identifiable information with third parties for
          advertising, research and marketing. Overall, we give Securly a B for
          privacy.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now let's talk about Google. Most people, if not all, use Google as
          their search engine of choice and may even use their products such as
          Docs, Sheets, Calendar, and many more. Google search receives around
          3.5 billion searches per day, or about 1.2 trillion searches per year.
          Since Google offers many different products, they have to store the
          data these projects receive on servers. This data may be the text you
          put in a Google Doc or the images you have on Google Photos. These
          servers cost money for Google to maintain and protect
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZmGGAbHqa0">(literally)</a>.
          If all of their products are free, how do they make money? Google uses
          targeted ads, and they use this data from the searches and data that
          you give Google. So how does Google share or use your personal
          information exactly? Before we reveal the answer, we must tell you
          that Google’s data collection is not limited to it’s website
          (google.com).
          <a href="https://donttrack.us"
            >Google trackers are on 75% of websites</a
          >, so data collection can happen on almost any website. After reading
          through a briefed edition of Google’s Terms of Service, Google can
          sell your personal data (medical, racial, ethnic, political, religious
          or sexuality), however you can
          <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">opt out</a> of
          hyper-specific info being shared. Unfortunately you can’t opt out of
          all of Google’s tracking. Your searches and data in google will be
          used for advertising and can also be used in subpoena. When using
          Google your device type and unique device identifiers are collected.
          This data is also kept forever. We give Google a F for privacy.
          <br />
          <br />
          In conclusion, be thoughtful about what you do online as everything
          can (and often will) be used for advertising (and maybe even against
          you in the case of a subpoena). Your data may be shared with third
          parties as we saw with Securly, however, it is often more dangerous
          when being used by a company like Google and not being shared. A few
          tools you can use to protect your privacy are the Firefox and Brave
          browsers that block many trackers and DuckDuckGo, a browser that does
          not track searches and personal information. To protect yourself at
          school, <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/schools-are-spying-students-students-can-fight-back">this is a good article to read</a>.
